# This is the default ansible 'hosts' file.
#
# It should live in /etc/ansible/hosts
#
#   - Comments begin with the '#' character
#   - Blank lines are ignored
#   - Groups of hosts are delimited by [header] elements
#   - You can enter hostnames or ip addresses
#   - A hostname/ip can be a member of multiple groups

# Ex 1: Ungrouped hosts, specify before any group headers.

#green.example.com
#blue.example.com
#192.168.100.1
#192.168.100.10

# Ex 2: A collection of hosts belonging to the 'webservers' group

# all host

# k8s-master

#[sw-man]
# x.x.x.x #ansible_python_interpreter='python3'

#[gw1-k8s]

#[local]
#127.0.0.1

#[dbservers]
#
#db01.intranet.mydomain.net
#db02.intranet.mydomain.net
#10.25.1.56
#10.25.1.57

# Here's another example of host ranges, this time there are no
# leading 0s:

#db-[99:101]-node.example.com
